This is not a travel website/agency! It is supposed to be something in between, but i don't know what it is. 
 Basically, the goal of this project was to showcase beautiful African countries. l kinda derailed at some point and started adding random things to the webpage (website was looking small so…). And in the end the website started looking like a travel agency or something.

Please do not get your hopes up. This isn’t one of them fancy shmancy react projects, this is my attempt at actually posting something to github. Honestly, I think the website is chaotic. Although, a lot of people don't agree with that. But, for some weird reason I like the project (even though I still think it's shit). So here I am posting it. Enjoy :)

Plus: This readme will continue to change as i add new features to this project.
